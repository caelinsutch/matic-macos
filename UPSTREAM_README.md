An async Python SDK and CLI for connecting directly to a Matic robot you own.
Pair once over Bluetooth, then read and control the robot through its
authenticated local-network service without a cloud relay.

> **Warning:** This project is unofficial, unaffiliated with Matic Robots, and
> based on independent protocol research. It is alpha software for hardware you
> own. Commands can move the robot or change persistent settings.

## What you can do

| Area | SDK capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Enrollment | Pair a Linux computer over Bluetooth and retain a private per-client `BotToken` |
| Live data | Decode 48 live-verified and one Stable 172 app-static collection target covering pose, operating state, Cues availability, motors, missions, schedules, history, media, settings, and maps |
| Motion | Stop, pause, stay put, dock, drive with direct joystick velocities, or navigate to a mission pose |
| Cleaning | Run mapped-room coverage, reprioritize an active plan, or clean a drawn dry-stain/wet-spill area |
| Maps | Build partitions; edit rooms, no-go/drive-only/stair zones, semantics, and sink-summon locations |
| Speaker and voice | Play or stop built-in seasonal tracks, send voice preferences, and control the Stable 172 user-audio processing state without claiming microphone-data access |
| Schedules and settings | Create schedules and change supported preferences through typed methods |
| Exports | Assemble RGB/coverage/semantic maps, export sparse colored voxels as PLY, and recover retained WebP media |

All 74 documented command intents have registered protocol-25 codecs. The
[verification ledger](https://github.com/Burgess-Software/unofficial-matic-sdk/blob/main/docs/command-verification.md)
distinguishes commands exercised on a real robot from formats proven only
through offline native serialization.

```text
Matic pairing mode ── Bluetooth once ──> private BotToken on this computer
this SDK           ── TLS + HTTP/2 over the LAN ──> robot Hermes service
```

## Quick start

You need Python 3.11 or newer. Bluetooth enrollment currently requires Linux
with BlueZ; Bluetooth is not needed after enrollment.

### 1. Install

```bash
python -m pip install --pre "unofficial-matic-sdk[all]"
matic --version
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.13 --prerelease allow \
  "unofficial-matic-sdk[all]"
matic --version
```

### 2. Pair once over Bluetooth

In the Matic app, open **Settings → Connectivity → Add another user**, enable
pairing mode, and keep the computer's Bluetooth adapter close to the robot.
Then run:

```bash
matic enroll --device-alias my-matic
```

Complete the BlueZ passkey prompt with the six-digit code displayed by Matic.
`my-matic` is only a local alias. The SDK creates its own client UUID and
saves the returned token in an owner-only credential directory without
overwriting an existing enrollment.

If you already have an owner-only serialized token:

```bash
matic credentials import-token \
  --device-alias my-matic \
  --source /secure/path/to/bot-token.pb
```

### 3. Identify the LAN endpoint and pin TLS

Find the robot's IP address or hostname in your router's DHCP/client list. The
SDK intentionally does not sweep the LAN.

```bash
export MATIC_DEVICE_ALIAS=my-matic
export MATIC_HOST=ROBOT_IP_OR_HOSTNAME
```

Confirm the unauthenticated identity before sending credentials:

```bash
matic probe --host "$MATIC_HOST" --insecure-read-only
```

Compare the returned serial number with a trusted record or physical device
label. Then inspect and pin the certificate:

```bash
matic tls fingerprint --host "$MATIC_HOST"
export MATIC_CERT_SHA256=VERIFIED_64_CHARACTER_SHA256
matic status
```

The fingerprint is a trust-on-first-use observation. See
[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Burgess-Software/unofficial-matic-sdk/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#pinning-the-robot-certificate)
for the full verification boundary and certificate-change guidance.

### 4. Read the command protocol version

Reads work without selecting a command protocol. Decode the retained version
model:

```bash
matic collections stream current_version \
  --count 1 \
  --duration 10 \
  --decode \
  --json
```

Use its `protocol_version` in programs that send commands:

```bash
export MATIC_PROTOCOL_VERSION=25
```

Version 25 is the verified baseline. Another positive version is accepted with
an `UnverifiedProtocolVersionWarning` instead of blocking the write.

## Read live robot data

List all 49 accepted targets:

```bash
matic collections list
```

The registry contains 48 targets verified against live robot collection
responses. Stable 172 live captures added `voice_available`,
`user_audio_recording_state`, `deep_mop_override_setting_state`,
`water_flow_override_state`, and `time_zone`. `bag_pass_status` has an exact
typed native schema but remains app-static because this account delivered no
current pass record during owner-authorized subscriptions.

Stream privacy-preserving event metadata:

```bash
matic collections stream latest_pose --count 20 --duration 30
```

Include the registered friendly model as JSON Lines:

```bash
matic collections stream latest_pose \
  --count 20 \
  --duration 30 \
  --decode \
  --json
```

The decoded view omits raw protobuf and media bytes. Names, network/account
data, pairing codes, and stable media hashes are redacted unless
`--include-sensitive` is explicitly supplied.

Record synchronized raw responses into a new private directory:

```bash
matic collections record captures/telemetry \
  --target latest_pose \
  --target kabuki_state \
  --target motor_status \
  --duration 30
```

Decode the saved directory later; its manifest supplies each target:

```bash
matic collections decode captures/telemetry --json
```

For one response file, pass its target:

```bash
matic collections decode event.pb --target latest_pose --pretty
```

## Capture maps, voxels, and media

### Assemble map tiles

```bash
matic collections record captures/map \
  --target map_compressed_rgb \
  --duration 20

matic maps decode captures/map \
  --output decoded-map \
  --target map_compressed_rgb
```

The decoder supports RGB, integrated, combined-coverage, semantic, and
semantic-override captures and assembles them in the canonical app orientation.
Categorical tiles also retain all 1,024 per-cell firmware codes through
`MapTile.classification`. Known codes decode to typed occupancy, semantic, or
override enums; unknown future codes remain available as `UnknownMapValue`
instead of being collapsed into an image mask.

```python
from matic_sdk import MapValueKind, SemanticsKind, UnknownMapValue
from matic_sdk.maps import classification_counts

event = await robot.first("map_semantics")
semantic_map = event.decode()
totals = classification_counts(semantic_map.tiles, MapValueKind.SEMANTICS)
print(totals.get(SemanticsKind.WIRE, 0))
print(
    {
        value.code: count
        for value, count in totals.items()
        if isinstance(value, UnknownMapValue)
    }
)
```

The named semantic categories are unknown, hard floor, carpet, wire, poop, and
generic pet. They are retained map classifications, not a live object-tracking
or raw camera inference endpoint.

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Decoded RGB map tiles assembled into one floor mosaic.</em></p>

### Export the sparse voxel surface

The compressed RGB collection also contains a `32 x 32 x 24` sparse colored
surface representation:

```bash
matic voxels export captures/map --output surface-map.ply
```

Use `--all-depths` for depths hidden by the app's normal surface rendering, or
`--coordinate-mode app-native` to preserve the native coordinate convention.

</p>
<p align="center"><em>The same capture exported as a colored PLY point cloud.</em></p>

### Extract retained media

```bash
matic collections record captures/thumbnails \
  --target coverage_session_thumbnails \
  --duration 10

matic media extract captures/thumbnails --output extracted-images
```

This recovers validated WebP containers already present in retained responses.
It does not start a recording or provide a live optical-camera stream.

## Use the Python API

Every known collection target decodes to a named immutable model. The in-memory
model also retains `raw_payload` and parsed `fields`, so newer protobuf fields
are not discarded.

```python
import asyncio
import os

from matic_sdk import MaticClient, MaticConfig, TlsConfig
from matic_sdk.models.collections import PoseCollectionModel


async def main() -> None:
    config = MaticConfig(
        host=os.environ["MATIC_HOST"],
        tls=TlsConfig.pinned(os.environ["MATIC_CERT_SHA256"]),
    )
    async with await MaticClient.connect_from_store(
        os.environ["MATIC_DEVICE_ALIAS"], config
    ) as robot:
        event = await robot.first("latest_pose")
        pose = event.decode()
        if isinstance(pose, PoseCollectionModel) and pose.pose is not None:
            print(pose.mission_id, pose.pose.translation, pose.observed_at)


asyncio.run(main())
```

For synchronized real-time control feedback:

```python
async with robot.telemetry() as updates:
    async for update in updates:
        print(update.model)
        latest_pose = update.latest_models.get("latest_pose")
```

The default telemetry set is `latest_pose`, `kabuki_state`, and `motor_status`.
See the runnable
[`decoded_telemetry.py`](https://github.com/Burgess-Software/unofficial-matic-sdk/blob/main/examples/decoded_telemetry.py)
example and the
[collection model reference](https://github.com/Burgess-Software/unofficial-matic-sdk/blob/main/docs/collections.md).

## Control the robot

Writes are direct typed method calls. This complete example sends Dock:

```python
import asyncio
import os

from matic_sdk import MaticClient, MaticConfig, TlsConfig


async def main() -> None:
    config = MaticConfig(
        host=os.environ["MATIC_HOST"],
        command_protocol_version=int(os.environ["MATIC_PROTOCOL_VERSION"]),
        tls=TlsConfig.pinned(os.environ["MATIC_CERT_SHA256"]),
    )
    async with await MaticClient.connect_from_store(
        os.environ["MATIC_DEVICE_ALIAS"], config
    ) as robot:
        receipt = await robot.commands.dock()
        print(receipt.transport.status.value)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Common methods include:

| Task | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Stationary control | `stop()`, `pause()`, `stay_put()` |
| Motion | `dock()`, `joystick()`, `navigate()`, `navigate_and_wait()` |
| Cleaning | `normal_coverage()`, `stain_mode()`, `reprioritize_coverage()` |
| Maps | `build_partition()`, room edit methods, zone/semantic/sink-location methods |
| Schedules | `add_or_modify_schedule()`, `toggle_schedule()`, `remove_schedule()` |
| Speaker and voice | `set_jukebox_track()`, `stop_jukebox()`, `set_voice_enabled()`, `set_user_audio_recording()` |
| Settings | `set_binary_setting()`, `set_auto_record_voice_enabled()`, `set_deep_mop_override_enabled()`, `set_water_flow_override()` |
| Cleaning mechanisms | `set_raw_motors()`, `diagnose_brush_roll_jam()`, `respond_to_brush_roll_jam()`, `dismiss_brush_roll_jam_outcome()`, `resolve_sweeper_maintenance()`, `trigger_sweeper_maintenance()` |
| Notifications | `register_live_activity()` |

`register_live_activity()` sends sensitive app notification credentials over
Hermes. It is notification plumbing rather than robot telemetry or control.
The SDK does not persist those credentials and hides them from object
representations and audit records.

Water-flow overrides use the official app range `0.5` through `2.0`; `1.0` is
the neutral/default multiplier.

Each `joystick()` call sends one velocity command. The SDK does not repeat it,
expire it, send zero, or Stop automatically:

```python
await robot.commands.joystick(linear_mps=0.05, angular_rad_s=0.0)
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
await robot.commands.joystick(linear_mps=0.0, angular_rad_s=0.0)
```

settings, and raw-motor examples are in the

## Safety and privacy

- BotTokens remain in owner-only files and are never printed by the SDK.
- TLS identity must be verified before authenticated commands are available.
- Map, media, schedule, pose, and collection captures can disclose details
  about a home. Keep them out of source control and public bug reports.
- Capture/export tools create private outputs and refuse accidental overwrite.
- The documented API has no arbitrary-payload command escape hatch and never
  retries an ambiguous command outcome automatically.

## Known boundaries

- Protocol 25 is the command-codec evidence baseline. Other positive versions
  warn and proceed with those codecs as a compatibility attempt.
- Bluetooth enrollment currently requires Linux and BlueZ.
- Some collection variants were observed only in an empty/default state, so
  optional model values remain `None` until that variant is emitted.
- Maps and voxels are decoded from captures; this is not a live map dashboard.
- Speaker control selects fixed built-in tracks; there is no arbitrary audio,
  volume, TTS, microphone-byte, or live microphone-stream API.
- Raw-motor commands are direct and wire-verified, have no device-specific
  range limits, and have not been exercised live.
- Normal operation is LAN-only; the portal-backed remote transport remains
  experimental.
- The SDK does not provide firmware images, root access, a filesystem, an SSH
  shell, or internal SLAM database access.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --group dev
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src/matic_sdk
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 uv run pytest -p pytest_asyncio.plugin
